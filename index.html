        <p>
            I am a basic block  level element.
            My adjacent block level elements 
            sit on new lines below me. 
        </p>
        <p>
            By default we span 100% of the width of our parent element,
            and we are as tall as our child content.
            Our total width and height is our content + padding + border width/height. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We are separated by our margins. Because of margin collapsing, we are
            separated by the width of one of our margins, not both.
        </p>
        <p>
            Inline elements <span>like this one</span>and <span>this one</span>sit on the same 
            line along with adjacent text nodes,if there is space on the same line.
            Overflowing inline elements will <span>wrap onto a new line if possible (
                like this one containig text)</span>
            or just go on to a new line if not,much like this image will do:
           <img src="pic.jpg" alt="dark forest"
            width="500px" height="300px"/>
        </p>
